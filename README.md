# IPTV_data_prediction
Classify set of IPDV data using Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression and Support Vector Machine.

The main purpose of this project is internet video quality prediction. Program gets three network state (Delay, Jitter, Drops) and assume quality degree (zero or one) of internet video. MLR, PR, SVM are used to complete this assumption.

Additional namespace is used in this prodject. It is Accord.Net.

Accord.NET provides statistical analysis, machine learning, image processing and computer vision methods for .NET applications. Once an extension to the former AForge.NET Framework, the framework grew to incorporate AForge.NET and complement it with new features, adding to a more complete environment for scientific computing in .NET.
